# Introduction

In my previous post [Numbers in Chiense](/posts/numbers-in-chinese) I went over the basics of numbers in Chinese, but I also mentioned once you've learnt some numbers you'll find it useful for saying other things like dates and time. In this post this is what I intend to do.

#### Saying the day of the week:

Before going over the days of the week one important word to know is the word for week 星期（xīng qí). Once you know this word then saying a day of the week becomes easy as saying the number of that day in a week. The only one that doesn't follow this pattern is Sunday, which uses 日（rì）which translates to day.

day of the week pattern
> 星期(xīng qí) + number of day of week (except Sunday)

|Day|Hanzi|Pinyin|
|:-|:-|:-|
| Monday | 星期一  | xīng qí yī |
| Tuesday | 星期二  | xīng qí èr |
| Wednesday | 星期三  | xīng qí sān |
| Thursday | 星期四  | xīng qí sì |
| Friday | 星期五  | xīng qí wǔ |
| Saturday | 星期六  | xīng qí liù |
| Sunday | 星期日  | xīng qí rì |

#### Saying a month of the year:

Months follow a similar pattern to days of the week, but the number comes first and the important word to learn is 月(yuè) which means month. So saying a month is as straight forward as saying the number of the month before the chinese word for month. 

month pattern
> number of month + 月(yuè)

|Month|Hanzi|Pinyin|
|:-|:-|:-|
| January | 一月  | yī yuè |
| February | 二月 | èr yuè |
| March | 三月 | sān yuè |
| April | 四月 | sì yuè |
| May | 五月 | wǔ yuè |
| June | 六月 | liù yuè |
| July | 七月 | qī yuè |
| August | 八月 | bā yuè |
| September | 九月 | jiǔ yuè |
| October | 十月 | shí yuè |
| November | 十一月 | shí yī yuè |
| December | 十二月 | shí èr yuè |

#### Saying the time:

There are two parts to saying the time in Chinese, just like most languages.

- 點 (diǎn) Point or o’clock - Like most words in Chinese a word can have multiple meanings, but in this context we are referring to time.
- 分（fēn）Minute

So knowing how to say o'clock and minute in Chinese, you say the number before each to say a time, just like the patterns below:

hour pattern
> number of hour + 點 (diǎn – o’clock)

minute pattern
> number of minute + 分 (fēn - minute)

|Time|Hanzi|Pinyin|
|:-|:-|:-|
| 10:30 | 十點三十分 | shí diǎn sānshí fēn |
| 2:13 | 兩點十三分 | liǎng diǎn shísān fēn |
| 5:55 | 五點五十五分 | wǔ diǎn wǔshíwǔ fēn |
| 7:40 | 七點四十分 | qī diǎn sìshí fēn |

#### Saying a date:

In Chinese, the following pattern is followed. The year goes first, then the month, then the day. If you know much about Chinese then you'll know this is a general pattern to follow `least specific` to `most specific`.
  
> year + 年（nián） / number of month + 月（yuè） / number of day 日（rì）

Examples:

|Date|Hanzi|Pinyin|
|:-|:-|:-|
| 2021, November, 9th | 二零二一年，十一月，九日 | èr líng èryī nián, shíyī yuè, jiǔ rì |
| 2014, March, 13th | 二零一四年，三月，十三日 | èr líng yīsì nián, sān yuè, shísān rì |
| 1998, December, 25th | 一九九八年，十二月，二十五日 | yījiǔjiǔbā nián, shí'èr yuè, èrshíwǔ rì |
