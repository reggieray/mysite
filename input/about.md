# Breif intro

Hi, my name is Matthew Regis. I am a software engineer working in the West Midlands, UK. I like building stuff, mainly with C# & .NET technologies. I have also worked on native mobile apps with more familiarity with Kotlin for Android and dabbled with Swift of iOS. 

You can find some of my personal Android projects [Here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Regis). You can also checkout my Github [Here](https://github.com/reggieray).

<hr />

**My first memory of coding**

> VBA in Microsoft Office - I was in high school at the time. I can't remember which one came first Excel or Access, but I remember editing a macro in VB. I didn't realize it at the time, but that was my frist experience at coding.

**Why build Android apps?**

> I owned one of the first Android devices (T-Mobile G1). I have since owned many other Android phones but this is what sparked my passion for wanting to create mobile apps, especially Android apps.
