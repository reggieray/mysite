Hi 👋🏽, my name is Matthew Regis. I am a software engineer 🧑🏽‍💻 working in the UK. I like building stuff with C# & .NET technologies. I also have familiarity with Kotlin for Android 🤖 and dabbled with Swift of iOS. 

This site mostly contains tech/code related blog posts, but is not strictly limited too tech/code. You may see the odd blog post on the Mandarin language 🈸 or Chinese culture ⛩️.

You can find some of my personal Android 📱 projects here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Regis](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Regis). You can also checkout my Github here: [https://github.com/reggieray](https://github.com/reggieray).

I give part of my time to volunteering for a charity organisation called A4U, which is a registered charity and disabled persons ♿ led organisation providing support to empower people with disabilities of all ages, their families and carers. I mainly offer my assistance with their website [http://a4u.org.uk/](http://a4u.org.uk/).

Below are recent certificates or courses I have completed:
