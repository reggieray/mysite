# Breif intro

Hi, my name is Matthew Regis. I am a software developer working in the West Midlands area. I am a full stack .NET and Android developer. I primarily use C# with .NET and Kotlin for Android. I like to learn every day to stay up to date on the latest Android/.NET technologies along with best practices. 

You can find some of my personal Android projects [Here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Regis). You can also checkout my Github [Here](https://github.com/reggieray).

# More info

Instead of laboriously reading through a wall of text, I've broken it down like a Q&A.

**First memory of coding**

> VBA in Microsoft Office - I was in high school at the time. I can't remember which one came first Excel or Access, but I remember editing a macro in VB. I didn't realize it at the time, but that was my frist experience at coding.

**First cool tech you owned**

> T-Mobile G1 - I have since owned many other Android phones but this is what sparked my passion for wanting to create mobile apps, especially Android apps. 

**What got you into I.T.**

> Probably playing PC games as a kid. I couldn't really afford a games console when I was much younger so instead I would buy PC games that I could play on my dad's PC. I would sometimes start exploring the game files to see what I could modify.

**Favorite game of all time**

> Half-Life - This was my first-ever FPS game I ever owned and still to this day it's the best game I have ever experienced. The graphics don't compare to todays standards, but the immersive gaming experience was like no other. I also really enjoyed playing Black Mesa which is a fan-made Half-Life remake.

**Something thats not tech related**

> I like to travel now and again, mostly to the Far East. In chronological order of places I've visited. I've been to Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.
